Description: Generate documentation from source code
 Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java,
 Python, IDL, Fortran, VHDL and to some extent D. It can generate an on-line
 documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX)
 from a set of annotated source files.
 .
 There is also support for generating RTF, PostScript, hyperlinked PDF,
 compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly
 from the sources.
 .
 Install the doxygen-latex package to build LaTeX based documents.

Description: Multi-language source code parser based on doxygen
 Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java,
 Python, IDL, Fortran, VHDL and to some extent D. Doxyparse builds on doxygen's
 great source code parsing infrastructure and provides a command-line tool that
 can be used to obtain information from source code, such as:
 .
  * which functions/methods and variables/attributes a module/class contains
  * which functions/methods calls/uses which functions/methods/variables
  * etc
 .
 doxyparses's main goal is to be used by higher-level source code analysis
 tools.
 .
 This package contains doxyparse binary, a source code parser based on doxygen
